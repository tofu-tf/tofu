### Typeclasses
Tofu exposes a handful of useful typeclasses, which can come in handy if you are a fan of Tagless Final approach 
(for basic understanding you can take a look [here](https://scalac.io/tagless-final-pattern-for-scala-code/) and [there](https://typelevel.org/blog/2018/05/09/tagless-final-streaming.html)).  
They allow more granular access to functionality, allowing you to see what exactly your code does.
