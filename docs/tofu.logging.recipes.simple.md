## Simple logging

All you need to do to start using logging in its simplest (and kinda boilerplate-y) form is the following:

- add Logging.Make as parameter to your service â€” that will describe the capability to create `Logging`s;
- create logging instance with method `Logging.Make[F].forService`.

That's it!

```scala
class MyService[F[_] : Monad : Logging.Make](someDependency: DependencyService) {

  private implicit val logging: Logging[F] = Logging.Make[F].forService[MyService[F]]

  def makeThis: F[Unit] = someDependency.foo(30) >> info"Something"

  def makeThat: F[Unit] = someDependency.foo(30).flatTap(result => warn"Some another thing $result")
}

```

At the app creation point you'll need to create the instance of Logging.Make by the method `Logging.Make.plain`:

```scala
def run: IO[ExitCode] = {
  implicit val makeLogging: Logging.Make[IO] = Logging.Make.plain[IO]

  val myService = new MyService[IO](???)

  ??? //the rest of the app
}
```

And if you have context inside your `F` you can use method `Logging.Make.contextual[F, Ctx]`:

```scala
def run: IO[ExitCode] = {
  implicit val makeLogging: Logging.Make[ReaderT[IO, SomeContext, *]] =
    Logging.Make.contextual[ReaderT[IO, SomeContext, *], SomeContext]

  val myService = new MyService[ReaderT[IO, SomeContext, *]](???)

  ??? //the rest of the app
}
```
