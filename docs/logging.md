## Installation

Logging are available as a separate project
`"tf.tofu" %% "tofu-logging" % tofu-version`

## Motivation

### Preface

Almost every application nowadays does logging, whether it is logging of business events, history of some state of
application or even debug record sequences. We log to files, distributed systems, standard outputs of OSes, and we got
used to it so much it seems simple to us. Many existing libraries provide many ways of logging from your application's
code, either automatic or manual.

### What's wrong (and how to fix that)?

First, logging is, in fact, a side effect. Whether we log anything to standard output or a file — it's an interaction
with the outside world ('outside' relative to our program). Thus, logging as a process can be represented as an effect
and operations - as an algebra.  
Second, logging itself seems easy, but stuff around it - not so much. MDC, contexts, structured logging - all these
things are very helpful on a day-to-day basis, allowing us to read and write our logs, making them clean, comprehensible
and useful for many purposes. But there are few simple ways to provide all this functionality without bleeding and
screaming from seeing over-engineered solutions.  
Tofu offers an easy and understandable abstraction over logging (it's even named like this!) but keeping in mind that
logging is an effect that can be composed.  
It looks very similar to interfaces we all are used to (from SLF4J and other logging libraries and facades), introducing
some new concepts:

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging.LoggedValue

trait Logging[F[_]] {
  def trace(message: String, values: LoggedValue*): F[Unit]

  def debug(message: String, values: LoggedValue*): F[Unit]

  def info(message: String, values: LoggedValue*): F[Unit]

  def warn(message: String, values: LoggedValue*): F[Unit]

  def error(message: String, values: LoggedValue*): F[Unit]
}

```

Basically, that's the main user API you can interact with throughout your code. It resembles well-known solutions,
keeping in mind that logging is an effect, though introducing the concept of `LoggedValue`.

## Representation

To represent a value in logs we use a concept of `Loggable` (it's a typeclass). It describes how a value of some type
can be logged, both as a string representation in log message and as a component of structured logging. Given an
instance of `Loggable` for a type, a value of the type can be converted into the final internal representation
called `LoggedValue` and thus logged in a way that you provided.  
There are multiple predefined ways to create an instance of `Loggable`, many of them can be found
in `tofu.logging.Loggable` object:

* `Loggable.empty` for no-op logging of value
* `Loggable.show` for using `cats.Show` instance as string representaion
* `Loggable.either` for logging either of `A` and `B`
* provided instances for all primitive types, as well as stdlib's collections and collections from Cats
* java.time.* instances

Of course, you can describe your `Loggable` instance yourself by extending existing traits that pre-implement some
functionality:

* `DictLoggable` for multi-field objects
* `ToStringLoggable` for using `.toString` for logging
* `HideLoggable` to exclude value from logging

### Loggable example

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging._
import cats.syntax.semigroup._

case class User(name: String, surname: String)

implicit val userLoggable = new DictLoggable[User] {
  override def fields[I, V, R, S](a: User, i: I)(implicit r: LogRenderer[I, V, R, S]): R = {
    r.addString("name", a.name, i) |+| r.addString("surname", a.surname, i)
  }

  override def logShow(a: User): String = s"name = ${a.name}, surname = ${a.surname}"
}
```

Let's take a look at this example.  
First, we define a loggable for our `User` class as a `DictLoggable` which means that we want to log it as a multi-field
object with structure.  
Second, we define two methods that describe how `User` should be logged:

* `fields`, that represents `User` as a structure, containing two fields with their respective names and values
* `logShow`, that represents `User` as a string in a log message


## Loggable derivation
a
Tofu has integration with [derevo](https://github.com/tofu-tf/derevo) library. It allows you to easily generate
instances of `Loggable[YourClass]` for case classes or ADTs:

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging.derivation.loggable
import derevo.derive

@derive(loggable)
case class Query(value: String, size: Int, isTagged: Tagged, tag: Tag)

@derive(loggable)
case class Tagged(b: Option[Boolean])

@derive(loggable)
sealed trait Tag

@derive(loggable)
case class DatabaseTag(db: String) extends Tag

@derive(loggable)
case object InMemoryTag extends Tag
```

so when logged

### Configuring Loggable generation

Tofu has several annotations to configure generation of `Loggable`

* `@hidden`
  ```scala:reset
  import tofu.logging.derivation.{loggable, hidden}
  import derevo.derive
  
  @derive(loggable)
  case class User(name: String, @hidden() password: String)
  
  ```
  `User("tofu", "pass")` will be logged as `User{name=tofu}`
* `@masked`
    ```scala:reset
  import tofu.logging.derivation.{loggable, masked, MaskMode}
  import derevo.derive
  
  @derive(loggable)
  case class Card(@masked(MaskMode.Erase) expirationDate: String, @masked(MaskMode.ForLength(4, 12)) cardNumber: String, @masked() owner: String)
  
  ```
  `Card(737, "1244345632322311", "TOFU PETROV")` will be logged as `Card{expirationDate=...,cardNumber=1244########2311,owner=**** ******}`
* `@unembed`
   ```scala:reset
  import tofu.logging.derivation.{loggable, unembed}
  import derevo.derive
  
  @derive(loggable)
  case class Scientist(@unembed owner: Person, age: Option[Int])
  
  @derive(loggable)
  case class Person(name: String)
  ```
  `Room(Person("Karl Sagan"), None)` will be logged as `Room{name=Karl Sagan, age=None}`


## Creation

Creating an instance of `Logging` in Tofu is an effect itself. You can use helper class `Logs` that can produce values
of type `I[Logging[F]]` (where `I` and `F` are intended to be two different effects, former is a `I`nitialization
effect (`Task` or `IO`)  and latter is some ReaderT-ish effect or just main program effect type, but they can be the
same though) and define a behaviour of your `Logging` instances. An instance of `Logs` is supposed to be shared by
different parts of user code. It's not a restriction though.

Tofu logs are built on top of existing Java logging infrastructure hence each logger for some class needs to have
distinctive name, as well as whole logging system has to be configured with a `logback.xml` (default configuration does
exist though).

`Logs` methods close the first requirement in different ways:

### Plain `Logging`

* by asking that name from user:
  For example here we create named instance and pass it explicitly.

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging._
import tofu.syntax.logging._
import tofu.syntax.monadic._
import cats._

class MyService[F[_] : Monad](logger: Logging[F]) {
  def makeFoo(arg: String): F[Int] =
    logger.info("Doing simplest thing").as(arg.length) <* logger.debug("Yep, counted length")
}

object MyService {
  def makeNamed[I[_] : Monad, F[_] : Monad](logs: Logs[I, F]): I[MyService[F]] =
    logs.byName("my-service-log").map(new MyService[F](_))
}

```

* by generating that name from type-parameter, which is a class intended to use logging with:

```scala:reset
def makeNamed[I[_] : Monad, F[_] : Monad](logs: Logs[I, F]): I[MyService[F]] =
  logs.byName("my-service-log").map(new MyService[F](_))
```

Logging instance created by this method for class `MyService[IO]` in package `com.bar.foo.pckg` will be
named `com.bar.foo.pckg.MyService`

### Typesafe `ServiceLogging`

Creating plain `Logging[F]` and using it around tends to be error-prune: one can easily pass logger created for
service `FooService` instead of `BarService`. Tofu has a solution — newtype `ServiceLogging[F, Service]`
and `LoggingCompanion` which contains simple type alias `Log[F[_]] = ServiceLogging[F, Service]`.

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging._
import tofu.syntax.logging._
import tofu.syntax.monadic._
import cats._

class FooService[F[_] : FooService.Log : Monad] {
  def makeFoo(arg: Int): F[String] =
    info"Doing yet another simplest thing".as(arg.toString) <* debug"Yep, called toString"
}

object FooService extends LoggingCompanion[FooService] {
  def make[I[_] : Functor, F[_] : Monad](logs: Logs[I, F]): I[FooService[F]] =
    logs.of[FooService].map(implicit l => new FooService[F])
}

```

Note that using it like `logs.named["foo"]` or `logs.byName("foo")` is going to fail compilation.

This is also the intended way to create `Logging[F]` or `ServiceLogging[F, Service]` instance for your classes.

### Ways to create Logs

There are multiple ways to create `Logs` instance, among them:

* `Logs.sync` that requires a `cats.effect.Sync` instance for delaying side-effects
* `Logs.withContext` that requires a `cats.effect.Sync` instance for delaying side-effects and a proof that `F` has a
  context to log
* `Logs.const` that wraps single `Logging` thus always returning the same instance
* `Logs.empty` that will produce a no-op `Logging` instances
* `Logs.combine` that combines two instances of `Logs`.
  `Logging` instance that is created this way will be a combination of two underlying instances, produced by both `Logs`
  . This means that both `Logging` implementations will be called in sequence

```scala:reset
import tofu.logging._

// for simplification, you can use whatever F you like
type F[A] = cats.effect.IO[A]

class MyService
class MyTaglessService[F[_]]
// defines simple logging behaviour without any notion of contexts
val syncLogs = Logs.sync[F, F]

// describing creation of logging instances and logging itself. When being run, this will log a message
val effect: F[Unit] = for {
  loggingBN <- syncLogs.byName("my-logger") // you can create instances by name
  loggingFS <- syncLogs.forService[MyService] // you can create instances by type of your non-tagless-final services
  loggingFS <- syncLogs.of[MyTaglessService] // you can create instances by type of your tagless-final services
  _ <- loggingBN.info("This is an INFO message")
  _ <- loggingFS.warn("This is a WARN message")
} yield ()
```

## Context logging

It is possible to log the context of your computations along with actual log message. Often it comes along with
structured logging. To illustrate it consider this pseudocode:

```
structuredLogger.info("I am a message", context = Map("transaction_id" -> 2342234, "request_name" -> "req"))
//it logs 
{ "level": "INFO", "message": "I am a message", "transaction_id": 2342234, "request_name": "req" }
```

That's neat, right? But it is verbose and clumsy to use, so tofu provides an abstraction for it.

If you have an instance of `tofu.Context` for your effect type and a `Loggable` for your context, you can have it logged
automagically. That is natural — describe how we can get a context from a computation `F` and a way to represent that
context in log, and we will ensure it will be logged anytime you use `Logging` operations. You can log that context to
string as well as use it as a part of structured logging.



### Example

```scala:reset
import tofu.WithRun
import tofu.logging.derivation.loggable._
import tofu.logging.{LoggableContext, Logging, LoggingCompanion, Logs}
import cats.{Functor, Monad}
import tofu.syntax.console._
import tofu.syntax.context._
import tofu.syntax.logging._
import tofu.syntax.monadic._
import tofu.zioInstances.implicits._
import zio._
import zio.interop.catz._

object Example extends zio.App {

  class BusinessService[F[_] : BusinessService.Log : Monad] {
    private def logic(arg: String): String = arg.repeat(3).replace("a", "b")

    def runLogic(arg: String): F[String] =
      info"Doing some business logic" as logic(arg)
  }

  object BusinessService extends LoggingCompanion[BusinessService] {

    def make[I[_] : Functor, F[_] : Monad](logs: Logs[I, F]): I[BusinessService[F]] =
      logs
        .of[BusinessService]
        .map(implicit l => new BusinessService[F])
  }

  case class RequestContext(id: Long, method: String)

  class Server[I[_] : Monad : Logging, F[_] : WithRun[*[_], I, RequestContext]](
                                                                                 business: BusinessService[F]
                                                                               ) {

    def handleRequest(request: Server.Request): I[Server.Response] = for {
      _ <- info"Got request $request"
      context = RequestContext(request.id, request.method)
      logicComputation = business.runLogic(request.body)

      result <- runContext[F](logicComputation)(context)

      response = Server.Response(result)
      _ <- info"Got response $response"
    } yield response

  }

  object Server {

    case class Request(id: Long, body: String, method: String)

    case class Response(answer: String)

  }

  type Contextual[A] = RIO[RequestContext, A]

  def run(args: List[String]): URIO[ZEnv, ExitCode] = {
    implicit val loggableContext: LoggableContext[Contextual] =
      LoggableContext.of[Contextual].instance[RequestContext]
    val contextLogs: Logs[Task, Contextual] = Logs.withContext[Task, Contextual]
    val mainLogs: Logs[Task, Task] = Logs.sync[Task, Task]

    for {
      implicit0(mainLogging: Logging[Task]) <- mainLogs.byName("main")
      bs <- BusinessService.make(contextLogs)
      server = new Server[Task, Contextual](bs)
      userRequest <- readRequest
      response <- server.handleRequest(userRequest)
      _ <- putStrLn[Task](s"Got response $response")
    } yield ()

  }.catchAll(_ => URIO.unit).as(zio.ExitCode.success)

  def readRequest: Task[Server.Request] =
    (
      readStrLn[Task]
        .map(_.toLongOption)
        .someOrFail(new Exception("Please provide numeric id")),
      readStrLn[Task],
      readStrLn[Task]
      ).mapN(Server.Request.apply)

}

```

#### Business Logic

We got `BusinessService` as our business logic. It does some stuff but most importantly it does not know it has any kind
of special logging. It just logs some stuff and all it needs for it is `Logging` instance.

As you can see it is created with the same factory-pattern as discussed before.

#### Server

Next we have a `Server` of some kind that should get some request, run some business logic on it and then return
response. Also, we want to have all the logs that business logic produces to have special RequestContext in it. To
achieve this we run the logic in special contextual effect type `F` which then can be evaluated into our main effect `I`
.
(More information on this can be found in scaladoc for `tofu.WithRun` etc.)
Moreover `Server` itself logs some messages and requires its own instance of `Logging`.

#### Loggable derivation

As one can see in [Representation part](#representation) for any of those logged values (like `$request`)  `Loggable`
instance should be in scope. In the example they are generated by macro, we just need to import it:

```scala
 import tofu.logging.derivation.loggable._
 ```

#### Running

It is a simple ZIO-app that reads user input from console and passes it to server. So when running possible output will
look like this, if ran with `ConsoleContextLayout` in `logback.xml`:

```bash
sbt>run
10102
foo bar body
GET
23:20:14 INFO  main - Got request Request{id=10102,body=foo bar body,method=GET}
23:20:14 INFO  c.t.c.n.c.Example$BusinessService - Doing some business logic
 [method=GET, id=10102]
23:20:14 INFO  main - Got response Response{answer=foo bbr bodyfoo bbr bodyfoo bbr body}
Got response Response(foo bbr bodyfoo bbr bodyfoo bbr body)
```

## Syntax extensions

It's much more convenient to use pre-defined syntax extensions for logging operations since they do all heavy lifting
for you:

```scala:reset
import cats.effect._
import cats.syntax.functor._
import cats.{Monad, Show, Functor}
import tofu.logging._
import tofu.syntax.logging._

case class User(name: String, surname: String)
object User {
  implicit val userShow: Show[User]         = user => s"name=${user.name}, surname=${user.surname}"
  implicit val userInstance: Loggable[User] = Loggable.show
}

val user: User = User("name", "surname")

class MyService[F[_]: Logging: Monad] {
  def doLogging: F[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- info"This is a syntax demo: $user"
    } yield ()
}

object MyService {
  def apply[I[_]: Functor, F[_]: Monad](implicit logs: Logs[I, F]): I[MyService[F]] = {
    logs.forService[MyService[F]].map(implicit l => new MyService[F])
  }
}

// An instance of `Logs` is supposed to be shared between mupltiple classes (or a single one for a whole application)
// Note that initializing effect of your application may differ from logging effect.
implicit val logs: Logs[IO, IO] = Logs.sync[IO, IO]

val io: IO[Unit] = for {
  service <- MyService[IO, IO]
  _       <- service.doLogging
} yield ()

io.unsafeRunSync()
// 13:56:26.918 [main] INFO tofu.logging.Test$MyService - This is a syntax demo: name=name, surname=surname
```

Using a syntax we achieve a few important goals.  
First, it will log a message containing a string representation of your value of type `User` as you defined it
in `Loggable` instance.  
Second, it will create a `LoggedValue` from your `Loggable` description and pass it to underlying logger and
your `LogRendered`, so your structured logging will work as expected.

## Integration with logs4cats

There is a library for effectual logging named [log4cats](https://github.com/typelevel/log4cats) which shares
the goal of representing logging as an effect and providing the ability to log context values. It is used by some of the
open-source libraries which may require you to pass an instance of `org.typelevel.log4cats.Logger` to it in order to
log something. Module `tofu-logging-log4cats` contains a helper that can create an instance of log4cats `Logger` from
our existing
`tofu.logging.Logging` one. If our `Logging` instance is contextual, it will continue leveraging that despite being
wrapped in log4cats `Logger`. Moveover, it will log context values that are passed to log4cats `Logger` API
as `Map[String, String]`.  
This means that not only you will not lose your context, but additional values that are passed to `Logger` will also be
logged.  
Let's take a look at the example:

```scala:reset
import org.typelevel.log4cats.{Logger, StructuredLogger}
import tofu.env.Env
import tofu.logging._

// Suppose we have some external APIs that leverage log4cats's Logger and StructuredLogger
def logWithLog4Cats[F[_]](implicit logger: Logger[F]): F[Unit] =
    logger.info("Hello Tofu!")

def logWithLog4CatsContextual[F[_]](implicit logger: StructuredLogger[F]): F[Unit] =
    logger.info(Map("field" -> "value"))("Hello contextual Tofu!")

// And we have our own context that can be logged as a structure
case class Context(start: Long)
object Context {
  implicit val loggable: Loggable[Context] = new DictLoggable[Context] {
    override def fields[I, V, R, S](a: Context, i: I)(implicit r: LogRenderer[I, V, R, S]): R =
      r.addInt("start", a.start.toInt, i)
    override def logShow(a: Context): String                                                  =
      a.toString
  }
}

// This context will be embedded in our Env monad and be logged at each logging call
type AppEnv[A] = Env[Context, A]
implicit val loggableContext: LoggableContext[AppEnv] = LoggableContext.of[AppEnv].instance
val logs: Logs[AppEnv, AppEnv]                        = Logs.withContext[AppEnv, AppEnv]

// first we need to import converter function
import tofu.logging.log4cats._
 
// then we can create an instance of Logger, passing an instance of tofu.logging.Logging implicitly
val env1: AppEnv[Unit] =
  logs.byName("Main").flatMap { implicit logging =>
    implicit val log4catsLogger: StructuredLogger[AppEnv] = toLog4CatsLogger
    logWithLog4Cats *> logWithLog4CatsContextual
  }

// or passing it explicitly in case you have more than one Logging instance in scope
val env2: AppEnv[Unit] =
  logs.byName("Main").flatMap { logging =>
    implicit val log4catsLogger: StructuredLogger[AppEnv] = toLog4CatsLogger(logging)
    logWithLog4Cats *> logWithLog4CatsContextual
  }

// you can also create an instance of Logger for each call, but this is not advised since it will make unnecessary allocations
val env3: AppEnv[Unit] =
  logs.byName("Main").flatMap(implicit logging => logWithLog4Cats *> logWithLog4CatsContextual)

// we can then import Scheduler and run our Env with some context
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

(for {
  _ <- env1.run(Context(123))
  _ <- env2.run(Context(456))
  _ <- env3.run(Context(789))
} yield ()).runSyncUnsafe(Duration.Inf)

// If we have a configured layout for structured logging, supporting context values (i.e. tofu.logging.ElkLayout)
// we will see JSON logs that contain not only values from our Context, but also values that were passed to log4cats Logger by the external API
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.059Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello Tofu!","start":123}
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.167Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello contextual Tofu!","start":123,"field":"value"}
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.168Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello Tofu!","start":456}
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.168Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello contextual Tofu!","start":456,"field":"value"}
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.169Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello Tofu!","start":789}
// {"@timestamp":"2020-10-31T14:11:31.169Z","loggerName":"Main","threadName":"main","level":"INFO","message":"Hello contextual Tofu!","start":789,"field":"value"}
```
