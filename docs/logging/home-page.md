# Welcome to the Tofu Logging Home page

This is a set of tools for logging. Configurable, concise, handy.

## Installation

Add these dependencies into your project:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "tf.tofu" %% "tofu-logging" % "<latest version in the badge in README>"
libraryDependencies += "tf.tofu" %% "tofu-logging-derivation" % "<latest version in the badge in README>"

```

For ZIO users the following is enough:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "tf.tofu" %% "tofu-logging-zio" % "<latest version in the badge in README>"

```

## Quick demo

```scala
import tofu.syntax.logging._
import tofu.logging.Logging
import derevo.derive
import tofu.logging.derivation.loggable

type CardNumber = String //could be a newtype

@derive(loggable)
case class Client(name: String, @hidden cardNumber: CardNumber, id: UUID)

def processPayment[F[_]: Monad: Logging](client: Client, amount: Long): F[Result] =
  for {
    _ <- info"Processing payment for $client"
    _ <- warn"Amount $amount is lower than zero!".whenA(amount < 0)
    result <- processData(client, amount, "USD")
                        .onError(errorCause"Got error on processing payment for $client"(_))
  } yield result
```
