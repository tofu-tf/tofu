## The problem
Often you see that in well modularized apps log messages are quite the same:

```scala
def method(args: Args) = for {
  _ <- info"Started method with $args"
  result <- foo(bar(args))
  _ <- info"Ended method with $result"
} yield result
```

`tofu.logging` allows to automatically generate those lines about entering and exiting the method.

## Autogenerated logging

You can automatically generate log messages stating when the method of some service has been entered and left.

```scala
import tofu.higherKind.derived.representableK
import derevo.derive
import tofu.logging.derivation._
import tofu.logging.Logging

@derive(representableK, loggingMid)
trait MyService[F[_]] {
  def makeThis: F[Unit]

  def makeThat(arg1: Int, arg2: String): F[Long]
}

object MyService extends Logging.Companion[MyService] {

  def make[F[_] : Logging.Make : Monad]: MyService[F] = {
    val core = new Impl[F]
    core.attachLogs
  }

  class Impl[F[_] : Monad] extends MyService[F] {
    //implementation
  }
}

```

There is also an alternative — loggingMidErr which also logs any error happened during method execution.

## How it works

The idea is based on the [Mid concept](/tofu/docs/higher-kind/mid). For every method `def foo(bar: Bar): F[Baz] = impl` it generates
it's logging compartment, looking close to that:

```scala
def foo(bar: Bar): F[Baz] = debug"Entering foo with $bar" *> impl <* debug"Exiting foo with $baz"
```
