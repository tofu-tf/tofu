# Recipes

Here is the list of ways how one can use `tofu.logging`

For any of the recipes you are going to need three things:

- ensure all the data types which you want to log have instances
  of [Loggable typeclass](../main-entities.md#typeclass-loggablea);
- import syntax: `import tofu.syntax.logging._`
- provide correct logback configuration (except when you are using `tofu.logging` with your own implementation) — you
  can find the description [here](../layouts.md) and the
  example [here](https://github.com/tofu-tf/tofu/tree/examples/src/main/resources/logback.groovy).

Recipes are:

- [Simple logging](simple.md) — when you just need to make the task done
- [Service logging](service.md) — same as latter but with a bit less code to write
- [Automatic logging](auto.md) derivation — when you don't even want to write log messages and your apps' modularization
  rocks
- [Custom logs](custom.md) — when you need to do something else when you log

And of course you can mix and match all of these to build what you want.
